## Railway Setup - 3 Steps

### Step 1: Get Resend API Key (2 minutes)

```bash
1. Go to: https://resend.com
2. Sign up / Log in
3. Navigate to: https://resend.com/api-keys
4. Click "Create API Key"
5. Copy the key (starts with "re_")
```

### Step 2: Set Railway Variables (1 minute)

**Option A: Railway Dashboard**
```
1. Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Open project: nerdx-accounting-system
3. Click your service ‚Üí Variables tab
4. Add these variables:

   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_key_here
   SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com

5. Click "Save" (auto-redeploys)
```

**Option B: Railway CLI**
```bash
railway variables --set RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_key_here"
railway variables --set SMTP_FROM_EMAIL="noreply@yourdomain.com"
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment (2 minutes)

```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs --filter "Resend"

# Expected output:
# [Resend] API Key configured: True
# [Resend] From: noreply@yourdomain.com
```

## Test Email Sending

### Quick Test via API

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/reports/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "your_email@example.com"}'
```

### Detailed Test via Script

```bash
# SSH into Railway
railway run bash

# Run test script
python test_email.py your_email@example.com
```

## Why Resend API?

### Railway SMTP Limitation
Railway blocks SMTP ports (25, 587, 465) for security and anti-spam reasons.

### Resend Solution
‚úÖ Uses HTTPS (port 443) - always open on Railway
‚úÖ HTTP-based API - no SMTP required
‚úÖ Free tier - 3,000 emails/month
‚úÖ Easy setup - single API key
‚úÖ Already implemented - code ready to go

---

## Environment Variables

### Required for Railway

```bash
# Email - Resend API
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here    # From https://resend.com/api-keys
SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com # Sender email address
```

### Not Required (Legacy SMTP - Blocked on Railway)

```bash
# These are NOT needed on Railway (SMTP is blocked)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_password
SMTP_USE_TLS=True
```

---

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [x] Email service code uses Resend API
- [x] `resend==0.8.0` in requirements.txt
- [x] Configuration files updated
- [x] Documentation created
- [x] Test script available

### Your Tasks
- [ ] Create Resend account
- [ ] Get API key from Resend
- [ ] Set `RESEND_API_KEY` in Railway variables
- [ ] Set `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL` in Railway variables
- [ ] Deploy to Railway

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Check Railway logs for "Resend API Key configured: True"
- [ ] Test email via API endpoint
- [ ] Receive test email in inbox
- [ ] Verify daily reports send correctly
- [ ] (Optional) Verify custom domain in Resend

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Resend API key not configured"
**Fix:** Set `RESEND_API_KEY` in Railway variables and redeploy

### "Connection refused" or SMTP errors
**Fix:** Should not happen - email service already uses Resend API (not SMTP)

### Email not received
**Check:**
1. Spam folder
2. Resend logs: https://resend.com/emails
3. Domain verification (for production)

### API endpoint returns 500
**Check:**
1. Railway logs: `railway logs --filter "Resend"`
2. API key is correct
3. No typos in email address

---

## Domain Verification (Optional - For Production)

### For Testing
‚ùå **Not needed** - Can send to any email using Resend test domain

### For Production
‚úÖ **Recommended** - Verify your domain for better deliverability

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
4. Add DNS records (SPF, DKIM)
5. Wait 5-30 minutes for DNS propagation
6. Click "Verify Domain"

**DNS Records:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: v=spf1 include:resend.com ~all

Type: TXT
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: [provided by Resend]
```

        resend.api_key = self.resend_api_key

    async def send_email(self, to_email, subject, html_body, text_body=None):
        params = {
            "from": settings.smtp_from_email,
            "to": [to_email],
            "subject": subject,
            "html": html_body,
        }
        if text_body:
            params["text"] = text_body

        response = resend.Emails.send(params)
        return True
```

### Configuration
