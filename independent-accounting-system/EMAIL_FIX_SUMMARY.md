# Railway Email Fix - Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Issue:** Railway blocks SMTP ports, preventing email delivery
**Solution:** Migrated to Resend API (HTTP-based email service)

---

## Problem Statement

Railway blocks SMTP ports (25, 587, 465) for security and anti-spam reasons. This caused all email sending to fail with connection errors when using traditional SMTP services like Gmail.

---

## Solution Implemented

### Email Service: Resend API

**Why Resend?**
- ✅ **Railway Compatible** - Uses HTTPS (port 443), not SMTP
- ✅ **Already Implemented** - Code was already using Resend API
- ✅ **Free Tier** - 3,000 emails/month, 100/day
- ✅ **Easy Setup** - Simple API, good documentation
- ✅ **Fast Integration** - Python SDK already in requirements.txt

### What Was Updated

The email service (`services/email_sender/email_service.py`) was already using Resend API. We only needed to:

1. **Update Configuration Files**
   - Added `RESEND_API_KEY` to `.env.example`
   - Updated `.env.railway` with Resend instructions
   - Removed old SMTP-only configurations

2. **Created Documentation**
   - `RAILWAY_EMAIL_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide (3,300+ words)
   - `RAILWAY_EMAIL_QUICKSTART.md` - 5-minute quick start
   - `EMAIL_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This file

3. **Created Test Script**
   - `test_email.py` - Comprehensive email testing tool
   - Tests both simple and custom formatted emails
   - Provides detailed error messages and troubleshooting

4. **Updated Deployment Docs**
   - Updated `README.md` with Resend configuration
   - Updated `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
   - Fixed environment variable references

## Current Email Service Implementation

### Architecture

```
Application (FastAPI)
    ↓
email_service.py (EmailService class)
    ↓
Resend Python SDK (resend==0.8.0)
    ↓
Resend API (HTTPS)
    ↓
Email Delivery
```

### Code Structure

**File:** `services/email_sender/email_service.py`

```python
import resend
from config import settings

class EmailService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.resend_api_key = settings.resend_api_key
        resend.api_key = self.resend_api_key

    async def send_email(self, to_email, subject, html_body, text_body=None):
        params = {
            "from": self.from_email,
            "to": [to_email],
            "subject": subject,
            "html": html_body,
        }
        response = resend.Emails.send(params)
        return True
```

**Key Features:**
- Async/await support
- HTML and plain text email support
- Error handling with detailed logging
- Last error tracking for debugging
- Test email method for validation

## Railway Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Resend API Key

1. Sign up at https://resend.com
2. Go to https://resend.com/api-keys
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the key (starts with `re_`)

### Step 2: Configure Railway Variables

**Via Railway Dashboard:**

1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Open your project
3. Go to Variables tab
4. Add:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_key_here
   SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
   ```
5. Click Save (auto-redeploys)

**Via Railway CLI:**

```bash
railway variables --set RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_key_here"
railway variables --set SMTP_FROM_EMAIL="noreply@yourdomain.com"
```

### Step 3: Verify Domain (Production Only)

**For Testing:** Skip this - use Resend's test domain

**For Production:**

1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
4. Add DNS records:
   ```
   Type: TXT
   Name: @
   Value: v=spf1 include:resend.com ~all

   Type: TXT
   Name: resend._domainkey
   Value: [provided by Resend]
   ```
5. Wait 5-30 minutes for DNS propagation
6. Click "Verify Domain"

## Testing Email Delivery

### Method 1: Test Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Local testing
python test_email.py your_email@example.com

# Railway testing
railway run python test_email.py your_email@example.com
```

**Expected Output:**
```
================================================================================
NERDX Email Service Test - Resend API
================================================================================

Configuration Check:
  - Resend API Key configured: True
  - From Email: noreply@yourdomain.com
  - Recipient Email: your_email@example.com

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sending test email...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Resend] ✅ Email sent successfully to your_email@example.com

================================================================================
✅ TEST PASSED: Email sent successfully!
================================================================================
```

### Method 2: API Endpoint

```bash
# Test email endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/reports/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "your_email@example.com"}'
```

### Method 3: Railway Logs

```bash
railway logs --filter "Resend"
```

Look for:
```
[Resend] API Key configured: True
[Resend] From: noreply@yourdomain.com
[Resend] ✅ Email sent successfully to ...
```

## Environment Variables

### Required Variables

| Variable | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | `re_abc123...` | Resend API key from https://resend.com/api-keys |
| `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL` | `noreply@yourdomain.com` | Sender email (domain must be verified in Resend) |

### Optional Variables (Legacy - Not Used on Railway)

| Variable | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SMTP_HOST` | `smtp.gmail.com` | SMTP server (blocked on Railway) |
| `SMTP_PORT` | `587` | SMTP port (blocked on Railway) |
| `SMTP_USERNAME` | `your_email@gmail.com` | SMTP username (not needed for Resend) |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | `app_password` | SMTP password (not needed for Resend) |
| `SMTP_USE_TLS` | `True` | SMTP TLS (not needed for Resend) |

**Note:** Legacy SMTP variables are kept in `config.py` for local development fallback but are not used on Railway.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Resend API key not configured"

**Solution:**
1. Check that `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in Railway variables
2. Verify the key starts with `re_`
3. Ensure there are no extra spaces
4. Redeploy after setting variables

### Problem: "Domain not verified"

**For Testing:**
- You can send to any email using Resend's test domain
- No verification needed for testing

**For Production:**
- Go to https://resend.com/domains
- Verify your domain with DNS records
- Wait for DNS propagation (5-30 minutes)

### Problem: Email sent but not received

**Check:**
1. Spam folder
2. Resend logs: https://resend.com/emails
3. Domain verification status
4. SPF/DKIM DNS records
5. Recipient email is valid

### Problem: "Connection refused" or SMTP errors

**This means:**
- Code is still trying to use SMTP instead of Resend API
- Should not happen with current implementation

**Fix:**
- Verify `email_service.py` is using Resend API
- Check `import resend` at top of file
- Ensure `resend.Emails.send()` is being called

---

## API Endpoints

### Test Email
```http
POST /api/v1/reports/test-email
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "your_email@example.com"
}
```

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "message": "Test email sent to your_email@example.com"
}
```

**Response (Error):**
```json
{
  "detail": "Resend API Error: ..."
}
```

### Send Daily Report
```http
POST /api/v1/reports/daily/{cell_id}/send?report_date=2025-10-27

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Security

✅ **DO:**
- Store API keys in Railway environment variables
- Use separate keys for dev/staging/production
- Rotate keys periodically
- Never commit keys to Git

❌ **DON'T:**
- Hardcode API keys in code
- Share keys via email/Slack
- Use production keys in development
- Log API keys in application logs

### Email Security

✅ **DO:**
- Verify your domain with SPF/DKIM
- Use dedicated sending domain
- Monitor bounce/complaint rates
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate recipient emails

❌ **DON'T:**
- Send from unverified domains
- Allow arbitrary recipient addresses
- Ignore bounce notifications
- Send without rate limits
