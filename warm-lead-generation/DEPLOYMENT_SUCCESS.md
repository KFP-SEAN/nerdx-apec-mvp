## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Core Issue
- **Field name mismatch:** Model expected `annual_revenue_usd`, API sent `annual_revenue_krw`
- **Wrong currency:** USD-based calculations for Korean market
- **Complex logic:** Overly complicated scoring reducing all scores

### Solution Implemented
1. **Currency change:** USD → KRW for all financial fields
2. **Field name alignment:**
   - `annual_revenue_usd` → `annual_revenue_krw`
   - `marketing_budget_usd` → `marketing_budget_krw`
   - Added missing fields: `relationship_duration_score`, `decision_maker_access_score`
3. **Simplified calculations:** Direct averaging instead of complex weighted sums
4. **Korean market scaling:**
   - Revenue: 100B KRW = 50 points, 1000B KRW = 100 points
   - Employees: 100 = 50 points, 1000 = 100 points
   - Marketing Budget: 1B KRW = 50 points, 10B KRW = 100 points

### Files Changed
- `models/nbrs_models.py` - Complete rewrite (288 lines)
- `test_fixed_nbrs.py` - Updated test data

### Commits
- `f2cfc90`: Fix NBRS calculation logic for accurate lead scoring
- `dc56b5d`: Add deployment status documentation

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Timeline
- **13:00:** Code fixed and tested locally ✅
- **13:05:** Committed to GitHub ✅
- **13:30:** Multiple redeploy attempts (auto-deploy not working)
- **14:06:** Manual redeploy via Environment Variable addition ✅
- **14:11:** Production verification successful ✅

### Deployment Method Used
**Environment Variable Addition:**
- Added `FORCE_REBUILD_V2=true` to Railway Variables
- This triggered a complete rebuild from latest GitHub commit
- Railway pulled latest code and deployed successfully

### Why Auto-Deploy Didn't Work
- Railway GitHub webhook may not have been configured
- Build cache was being reused despite code changes
- Manual trigger via Environment Variable change was required

---

## 📈 Impact

### Business Impact
- **Before:** 100% of leads incorrectly classified as TIER4 (low priority)
- **After:** Accurate tier classification enabling proper lead prioritization
- **NERD12 Goal:** Can now identify top 10% warm leads to reach 500M KRW MRR

### Technical Impact
- NBRS scores now range 0-100 as designed
- Tier distribution follows expected pattern
- Korean market scaling factors properly applied
