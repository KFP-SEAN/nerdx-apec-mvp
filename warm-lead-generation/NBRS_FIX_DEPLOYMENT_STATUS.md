# NBRS Fix - Deployment Status

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** ‚úÖ Code Fixed & Committed | ‚è≥ Awaiting Railway Redeploy

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### 1. NBRS Model Completely Rewritten
**File:** `models/nbrs_models.py`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Changed all USD fields to KRW (annual_revenue_krw, marketing_budget_krw)
- ‚úÖ Fixed field names to match API inputs (past_interaction_score, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Simplified calculation logic: each pillar returns 0-100 via simple averaging
- ‚úÖ Adjusted scaling factors for Korean market

**Scaling Factors (Korean Market):**
- Revenue: 100B KRW = 50 points, 1000B KRW = 100 points
- Employees: 100 = 50 points, 1000 = 100 points
- Marketing Budget: 1B KRW = 50 points, 10B KRW = 100 points
- Website Traffic: 10K/month = 50 points, 100K/month = 100 points
- Social Followers: 5K = 50 points, 50K = 100 points

### 2. Local Testing Completed
**Test Results (test_fixed_nbrs.py):**

```
TIER1 Lead (Premium Corp):
  Brand Affinity: 100.00
  Market Positioning: 98.75

### 3. Code Committed to GitHub
- ‚úÖ Commit: `f2cfc90` - "Fix NBRS calculation logic for accurate lead scoring"
- ‚úÖ Pushed to main branch
- ‚úÖ Repository: KFP-SEAN/nerdx-apec-mvp

## ‚è≥ Pending: Railway Redeploy

### Current Production Status
**URL:** https://warm-lead-generation-production.up.railway.app

**Issue:** Production is still running the OLD model
- Current NBRS for premium lead: 15.17 (TIER4) ‚ùå
- Expected NBRS for premium lead: ~99 (TIER1) ‚úì

### Why Railway Hasn't Redeployed

Railway auto-deployment may not be configured for the GitHub integration. Options:

#### Option 1: Manual Redeploy via Railway Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)

1. Go to Railway Dashboard:
   ```
   https://railway.app/project/53c2f700-32ca-491f-b525-8552114b6fd6
   ```

2. Click on "warm-lead-generation" service

3. Click "Deployments" tab

4. Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy" button

5. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to complete

6. Verify fix with test command below

#### Option 2: Enable Auto-Deploy from GitHub

1. Go to Railway Dashboard ‚Üí warm-lead-generation service

2. Click "Settings" tab

3. Under "Deploy" section:
   - Ensure "Source" is set to GitHub repo: KFP-SEAN/nerdx-apec-mvp
   - Ensure "Root Directory" is set to: warm-lead-generation
   - Ensure "Branch" is set to: main
   - Enable "Auto-deploy on push to main"

4. Save settings

5. Click "Redeploy" to trigger immediate deployment

## üß™ Verification Test

After Railway redeploys, run this test:

### Test Command
```bash
curl -X POST "https://warm-lead-generation-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/lead-scoring/calculate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "lead_id": "final-verification-test",
    "company_name": "Premium Verification Corp",
    "brand_affinity": {
      "past_interaction_score": 95,
      "email_engagement_score": 98,
      "meeting_history_score": 92,
      "relationship_duration_score": 95,
      "contact_frequency_score": 94,
      "decision_maker_access_score": 98,
      "nps_score": 95,
      "testimonial_provided": true,
      "reference_willing": true
    },
    "market_positioning": {
      "annual_revenue_krw": 500000000000,
      "employee_count": 1000,
      "marketing_budget_krw": 5000000000,
      "target_industry_match": true,
      "target_geography_match": true,
      "pain_point_alignment_score": 95,
      "revenue_growth_yoy": 50,
      "expansion_plans_score": 95
    },
    "digital_presence": {
      "website_traffic_monthly": 500000,
      "social_media_followers": 100000,
      "content_engagement_score": 95,
      "modern_website": true,
      "marketing_automation": true,
      "mobile_app": true,
      "ecommerce_enabled": true
    },
    "update_salesforce": false
  }'
```

### Expected Result
```json
{
  "lead_id": "final-verification-test",
  "company_name": "Premium Verification Corp",
  "nbrs_score": 99.25,  // ‚Üê Should be ~99, NOT 15.17!
  "tier": "tier1",      // ‚Üê Should be tier1, NOT tier4!
  "brand_affinity_score": 100.0,
  "market_positioning_score": 98.75,
  "digital_presence_score": 98.75,
  "calculated_at": "...",
  "next_action": "ÏãúÎãàÏñ¥ ÏòÅÏóÖ Îã¥ÎãπÏûê Ï¶âÏãú Î∞∞Ï†ï (Assign to senior sales rep immediately)",
  "priority_rank": null
}
```

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ `nbrs_score` is between 95-100 (not 15.17)
- ‚úÖ `tier` is "tier1" (not "tier4")
- ‚úÖ `brand_affinity_score` is ~100
- ‚úÖ `market_positioning_score` is ~99
- ‚úÖ `digital_presence_score` is ~99

## üìä Summary

### What Was Fixed
**Before:**
- All leads scoring as TIER4 regardless of quality
- Field mismatch: Model expected USD, API sent KRW
- Premium lead: NBRS 15.17 ‚Üí TIER4 ‚ùå

**After:**
- Proper tier classification across all ranges
- KRW-based Korean market scaling
- Premium lead: NBRS 99.25 ‚Üí TIER1 ‚úì

### Files Changed
1. `models/nbrs_models.py` - Complete rewrite
2. `test_fixed_nbrs.py` - Updated test data

### Commits
- f2cfc90: Fix NBRS calculation logic for accurate lead scoring
- 3627182: Trigger Railway redeploy with fixed NBRS model

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Manual Redeploy on Railway Dashboard**
   - Takes 1-2 minutes
   - No configuration changes needed

2. **Run Verification Test**
   - Use curl command above
   - Verify NBRS score is ~99 (not 15.17)

3. **Test with Real Production Data**
   - Run actual leads through the system
   - Verify tier distribution matches expectations

4. **Monitor System**
   - Check `/api/v1/lead-scoring/stats` for tier distribution
   - Expected: ~10% TIER1, ~30% TIER2, ~40% TIER3, ~20% TIER4

---

**Status:** Ready for Railway redeploy via dashboard
**ETA:** 2-3 minutes after manual redeploy
**Confidence:** High (all local tests passing)
