# ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Railway Redeploy Required

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** Code fixed & committed ‚úÖ | Railway redeploy needed ‚è≥

---

## üéØ Issue

NBRS calculation logic has been **completely fixed** and all local tests pass, but Railway production is still running the **old buggy version**.

### Current Production Status
- ‚ùå NBRS Score: 15.17 (should be ~99 for premium leads)
- ‚ùå Tier: TIER4 (should be TIER1)
- ‚ùå Using old USD-based model with field mismatches

### Expected After Redeploy
- ‚úÖ NBRS Score: 99.25 for premium leads
- ‚úÖ Tier: TIER1 for premium leads
- ‚úÖ Using new KRW-based model with correct calculations

## üöÄ How to Fix: Manual Redeploy via Railway Dashboard

### Step 1: Access Railway Dashboard

Open this URL in your browser:
```
https://railway.app/project/53c2f700-32ca-491f-b525-8552114b6fd6
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Service

1. Click on **"warm-lead-generation"** service (in the services list)

### Step 3: Trigger Redeploy

**Option A: Quick Redeploy**
1. Look for the **"Deployments"** tab at the top
2. Click on it
3. Find the latest deployment entry
4. Click the **"‚ãÆ"** (three dots menu) on the right
5. Select **"Redeploy"**
6. Confirm the redeploy

**Option B: New Deployment**
1. Click the **"Deploy"** button (usually at top right)
2. Wait for deployment to start

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment

1. Watch the deployment logs in the "Deployments" tab
2. Wait for status to change to **"SUCCESS"** (usually 1-2 minutes)
3. Look for message like: `Application startup complete`

### Step 5: Verify Fix

Run this test command:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://warm-lead-generation-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/lead-scoring/calculate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "lead_id": "verification-after-redeploy",
    "company_name": "Premium Verification Corp",
    "brand_affinity": {
      "past_interaction_score": 95,
      "email_engagement_score": 98,
      "meeting_history_score": 92,
      "relationship_duration_score": 95,

      "employee_count": 1000,
      "marketing_budget_krw": 5000000000,
      "target_industry_match": true,
      "target_geography_match": true,
      "pain_point_alignment_score": 95,
      "revenue_growth_yoy": 50,
      "expansion_plans_score": 95
    },

      "mobile_app": true,
      "ecommerce_enabled": true
    },
    "update_salesforce": false
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "nbrs_score": 99.25,  // ‚Üê Should be ~99, NOT 15.17!
  "tier": "tier1",      // ‚Üê Should be tier1, NOT tier4!
  "brand_affinity_score": 100.0,
  "market_positioning_score": 98.75,
  "digital_presence_score": 98.75
}
```

- [ ] Brand Affinity Score is ~100 (not ~20)
- [ ] Market Positioning Score is ~99 (not ~7)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If Auto-Deploy Isn't Working

Railway may need GitHub webhook configuration:

1. Go to Railway Dashboard ‚Üí warm-lead-generation service
2. Click **"Settings"** tab
3. Under **"Source"** section:
   - Verify repo: `KFP-SEAN/nerdx-apec-mvp`
   - Verify branch: `main`
   - Verify root directory: `warm-lead-generation`
4. Under **"Deploy"** section:
   - Enable **"Auto Deploy"** toggle
   - Check **"Deploy on Push"** is enabled
5. Save settings
6. Trigger manual redeploy

### If Deployment Fails

Check deployment logs for errors:
1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Click on the failed deployment
3. View logs
4. Common issues:
   - Missing dependencies: Check `requirements.txt`
   - Port binding: Check `main.py` uses `PORT` env var
   - Environment variables: Verify all 17 vars are set

## ‚è±Ô∏è Next Steps

1. **Manual redeploy on Railway** (2-3 minutes)
2. **Run verification test** (above)
3. **Confirm NBRS scores are correct**
4. **Test with real production data**
5. **Monitor tier distribution via `/api/v1/lead-scoring/stats`**

**Status:** Awaiting manual Railway redeploy
**Priority:** HIGH - Production using incorrect NBRS calculations
**Impact:** All leads incorrectly classified as TIER4
**ETA:** 3-5 minutes after manual redeploy
