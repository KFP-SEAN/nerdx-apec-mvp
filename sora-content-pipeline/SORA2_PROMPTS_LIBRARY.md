## 🎬 Phase 1: 티저 콘텐츠 Prompts

### Prompt 1.1: "Sam's Mysterious Package"
```
[Sora 2 Prompt - Duration: 20 seconds]

SCENE SETTING:
Modern minimalist office in San Francisco, golden hour lighting streaming through floor-to-ceiling windows. Warm, inviting atmosphere.

CAMERA:
Start with a slow dolly-in shot from medium to close-up. Smooth, cinematic movement. 24fps for film-like quality.

ACTION SEQUENCE:
- A sleek black package with subtle Korean pattern (mother-of-pearl inlay style) sits on a wooden desk
- Hands (masculine, professional) carefully unwrap the package
- Reveal: Premium NERD12 bottle with iridescent holographic label
- As fingers touch the label, it shimmers and glows with soft AR-like effect
- Holographic light particles rise from the bottle, forming Korean characters "즐거움" (Joy)
- Characters morph into English "DISCOVER KOREAN JOY"

VISUAL STYLE:
- Color grading: Warm with teal shadows (cinematic look)
- Bokeh depth-of-field on background
- Product hyper-realistic with slight glow
- Particle effects: Soft, magical, not overly CG
- Reference: Apple product reveal aesthetic meets Korean traditional art

AUDIO CUES (for music sync):
- Gentle gayageum pluck when package opens
- Ambient electronic undertones
- Soft whoosh for holographic reveal

TEXT OVERLAY (appears at end):
"An invitation from Korea"
"October 2025 | APEC CEO Summit"
"With Sam Altman & OpenAI Sora"
```

---

### Prompt 1.2: "Portal to Korea"
```
[Sora 2 Prompt - Duration: 30 seconds]

SCENE TRANSITION (Morphing sequence):

PART 1 (0-10s):
Camera slowly zooms into the NERD12 bottle label. The holographic Korean pattern begins to animate, expanding to fill the frame.

PART 2 (10-20s):
Pattern transforms into a portal/tunnel effect. Camera "travels through" the pattern, which evolves from modern digital to traditional Korean tile mosaic (dancheong colors: blue, red, green, yellow).

PART 3 (20-30s):
Emerge from the portal into a breathtaking scene:
- Traditional Hanok village (Bukchon style) at twilight
- Paper lanterns glowing warmly
- In the foreground: Traditional brewery with large clay jars (hangari)
- In the background: Modern Seoul skyline (Lotte Tower, Gangnam) visible but softly blurred
- AR elements floating subtly: digital cherry blossoms, light particles

CAMERA:
Single continuous shot (oner). Starts as dolly-in, becomes a travel/fly-through, ends as crane-up reveal shot.

LIGHTING:
Blue hour (civil twilight) - that magical moment when traditional lanterns and modern city lights are both visible. Warm practical lights (lanterns) vs cool ambient twilight.

MOOD:
Wonder, invitation, cultural depth meets innovation. Should feel like stepping into a beautiful secret.

ENDING:
Fade to text: "Sam Altman's Korean Joy Journey / Coming October 2025"
```

- Ancient Korean temple in the distance
- He carries a wooden chest
- Camera: Aerial drone shot descending to follow him
- Cherry blossoms fall (seasonal beauty)

Act 2: The Discovery (20-40s):
- Inside temple courtyard
- Sam meets three mystical guardians (stylized, fantasy elements):
  * Guardian of Rice (representing ingredients)
  * Guardian of Water (representing purity)
  * Guardian of Fire (representing distillation)
- They circle around him as he places the chest in the center
- He opens it: Glowing NERD12 bottle inside
- Guardians bow in approval
- Light emanates from the bottle, transforming the courtyard

Act 3: The Celebration (40-55s):
- Rapid montage to modern time
- Sam (back in contemporary clothes) in bustling Korean street food market
- People of all ages enjoying NERD products
- Cross-cultural moments: Sam sharing drinks with locals, laughter
- Korean grandmother offering him food, young tech workers toasting
- AR elements: Floating lanterns, digital cherry blossoms

Closing (55-60s):
- Pull back to reveal: This entire story is displayed on the lab screen
- Cut to real Sam watching his own story, amazed expression
- He looks at camera: "That's incredible"
- Screen shows: "Your turn. Create your Korean Joy story."

CRITICAL NOTES:
- Sam's digital double must be seamless, respectful, heroic
- Balance whimsy with sophistication
- Korean cultural elements must be authentic, not appropriative
- The "magic" is AI-powered personal storytelling, make that clear

MUSIC:
Traditional Korean orchestral (haegeum, daegeum, janggu) meets epic cinematic score. Think "Kingdom" (Netflix) soundtrack.
